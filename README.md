# 🧭 GxPlan
### *Plan in Compliance.*

**GxPlan** is a lightweight project and task management application designed for regulated industries — where planning, prioritization, and traceability matter as much as productivity itself.  
Built with **PureBasic** and **SQLite**, it offers an entirely local, auditable environment for managing projects, tasks, notes, calendars, and time allocation — all in compliance with GxP and data integrity principles.

## 🧩 Main Features

- **Project and Task Management**  
  Create, categorize, and prioritize projects and tasks with flexible weighting factors for multi-criteria prioritization.

- **Compliance-Driven Planning**  
  Inspired by *GAMP 5* and *Good Documentation Practices (GDP)* — encouraging traceable and structured planning.

- **SQLite Local Storage**  
  Portable, file-based database — no server required, ensuring data integrity and easy backup.

- **Rich Text Notes with Scintilla Editor**  
  Integrated *Scintilla* component allows formatted text editing for notes, logs, and meeting records.

- **Calendar and Timeline Views**  
  Daily calendar, compact scheduler, and basic Gantt-style view for temporal organization.

- **Future Modules (Roadmap)**  
  - Scrum and Kanban visual management _(currently in development)_
  - Time tracking and effort allocation logs  
  - Risk and impact analysis dashboard  
  - Integration with CSV or XML for validation documentation

## ⚙️ Philosophy — “Plan in Compliance”

GxPlan was born from the intersection between **engineering**, **project management**, and **regulated industry requirements**.  
Its motto, *Plan in compliance*, reflects the principle that **planning is part of the validation lifecycle** — every task, priority, and decision should be reasoned, recorded, and traceable.

## 🧠 Inspiration

GxPlan combines simplicity with rigour — much like a digital laboratory notebook for project managers.  
It is especially suitable for:
- Validation and QA teams in GxP environments  
- Engineering departments managing multiple regulated projects  
- Professionals who value offline tools with full data ownership  


## 🪶 Slogan

> **“Plan in compliance — because traceability begins with planning.”**
